AURshell
--------

.. or simply `aursh` is is Python shell, that should help you with building
and installing packages from ABS and AUR. It also can be pacman wrapper (but
actually pacman is awesome without any third party tool), and even more -just
write plugin.

How to start?
=============

1. Download PKGBUILD, extract it, build package, install:

    # wget http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aurshell-git/aurshell-git.tar.gz
    # tar -xvvf aurshell-git.tar.gz
    # cd aurshell-git
    # makepkg -i

2. Read the install message and copy base configuration file to your `$HOME`
   directory

    # cp /usr/share/aurshell/aurshell.conf $HOME/.aurshell 

3. Run `aursh`. Type either `aursh` to start interactive shell or `aursh
<command>` to use it as simple script. 

4. Use `help` command to learn how to use it.
