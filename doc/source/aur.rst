aur usage example
-----------------

This is quick example of how to use aursh to search & install package from
AUR.

First, search for package to see if it's in AUR::

    # aursh Ss aursh
            Name: aurshell-git
     Description: Shell for Arch Linux AUR management - currently under rewrite
         Version: 20100103-1

            Name: aursh-git
     Description: yet another AUR manager
         Version: 2-3


As you can see, instead od `aur search` you can just type `Ss`. This is an
allias, which can be changed in configuration file.

`Ss` option is using AUR json API, so it does not contain all informations.
But you may use `Si` (or `aur info`) which is parsing PKGBUILD file, to get
all data possible::

    # aursh Si aursh-git
    ==> reading PKGBUILD: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aursh-git/aursh-git/PKGBUILD
             Pkgname: aursh-git
         Contributor: Piotr Husiaty≈Ñski <phusiatynski@gmail.com>
              Pkgrel: 3
              Pkgver: 2
             Pkgdesc: yet another AUR manager
                Arch: i686, x86_64
             License: GPL
             Depends: python>=2.6
         Makedepends: git
            Replaces: aurshell-git

Installation is also very simple::

    # aursh S aursh-git
    ==> downloading package: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/aursh-git/aursh-git.tar.gz
    ==> Determining latest git revision...
      -> Version found: 20100216
